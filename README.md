A C++ project that uses several methods of evolutionary algorithm selection and compares their efficiency.

For a visual reprentation of the puzzle being solved please visit: https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/

Loading each log file will run a different set of evolutionary algorithms with variations in parent selection, survival strategy, and child selection.

The TestData Excel spreadsheet contains the results of one particular round of testing and the Analysis Word document compares the final results.

Enjoy,
